    "### Final Remark\n",
    "The first thing I'll say is university campuses are the cash cows of the bike sharing world. Buch campus being a glowing example. By their dorms and shopping center they have high volume bike stations that are in constant very high demand, by their classes they have more bike stations also high in demand and right on campus they have a massive bike sharing station on the edge of the park so all the young people can go out and bike around the trails. Every station on that campus is used to its full potential. A lot of the students are active, a lot of the students don't have a lot of money or a car, and a lot of the students do fun things. Needless to say if a company has the oportunity to put their bikesharing stations on and around a campus they should take it over every other opportunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "However if you want your stations to collect dust you can put small capacity stations on every block of the inner city. Do they make the city more bike accessible? Sure. Do they put a healthy return into the pocket of a private company? No. Leave it to the government. Locals who cycle likely have their own bikes, and tourists are far more likely to rent a bike and cycle around the waterfront, a beautiful park, or an old city shopping plaza designed for foot traffic than do circles around your apartment complex. Do these stations get used? yes but if you're looking for a station that can justify having a large capacity and utilize the majority of that capacity nearly every day these aren't the types of stations you want. If you set up a bunch of these stations you're also likely to have some that are prone to vandalism/theft/misuse which cuts further into your profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that 'tourist trap' places like landmarks and famous spots will naturaly be more active during tourist season. A more consistent activity and more use from locals would could from setting up stations by parks/bike paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary: campuses are your ideal first choice, nature, walkways, landmarks, foot traffic plazas come next."

On the bright side the log-likelihood seems relatively low, compared to my last models at least. One neat thing is the coefs are all negative. This means the model would initially assume a higher total_bikes value then based on if these columns were true it would decrease that count."
