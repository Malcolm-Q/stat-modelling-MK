# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
* Organization
    * More pushes to GitHub.
    * Cleaner Markdown files.
    * More comments in code.
    * code readability > code conciseness.
* Develope Statistical Modeling Skills
    * While I can learn to use modules for statistical modeling quickly I don't quite have an intuitive comprehension of how to apply everything.
    * In other words I can do many things in the world of statistical modeling but I have a poor fundemental understanding of the things I am doing.
    * This naturally harms my confidence working with statistical modeling so I am aiming to build a stronger comprehension by the end of the project.
