## Project/Goals
* Organization
    * More pushes to GitHub.
    * Cleaner Markdown files.
    * More comments in code.
    * code readability > code conciseness.
* Develope Statistical Modeling Skills
    * While I can learn to use modules for statistical modeling quickly I don't quite have an intuitive comprehension of how to apply everything.
    * In other words I can do many things in the world of statistical modeling but I have a poor fundemental understanding of the things I am doing.
    * This naturally harms my confidence working with statistical modeling so I am aiming to build a stronger comprehension by the end of the project.

## Process
### (your step 1)
### (your step 2)

## Results
(fill in what you found about the comparative quality of API coverage in your chosen area and the results of your model.)

## Challenges 
* I go over this in much greater detail in [yelp_foursquare_EDA](/notebooks/yelp_foursquare_EDA.ipynb) but I was very mindful of potential overlap in POIs. Basically I played around with the radius I pulled POIs from to balance data loss and data overlap. The root of this problem is both APIs don't return POIs ordered by how close they are to the origin.
* On this topic there's also the element of verticality. If you're in an area with a large many story office building there's potential to have the problem I stated above return only/mostly businesses in that office which are likely similiar or even the same category and neglecting other, different POIs in the radius. I approached this in the same way through experimenting with the radius and visualizing the response.

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
